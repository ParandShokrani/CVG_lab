    <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
      Dr. Catalina Vallejo-Giraldo’s research focuses on the intersection of biomaterials, brain mechanobiology, and medicine.
      She has received extensive international training, including academic experience at Universidad EIA in Colombia,
      Imperial College London, Cardiff University, and the University of Galway. Catalina has also gained industry experience
      at Neurent Medical in Ireland and clinical experience at the Mayo Clinic in the USA.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
      Her work includes the development of advanced biomaterials for neural interfaces and tissue engineering, with the
      aim of creating novel treatment modalities for neurological disorders, including Glioblastoma (GB).
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4" style="text-align: justify;">
      Recently, she was awarded an ERC starting grant to develop a novel treatment modality for GB.
      Additionally, she serves as a referee for several international journals, is an early-career editorial board member
      of the FASEB Journal, and is a member of the Editorial Review Board for the Journal of Tissue Engineering (JTE).
